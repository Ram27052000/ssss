      <h3> Early Years </h3>
      <p>Tendulkar was born at Nirmal Nursing Home in Dadar, Bombay on 24 April 1973
         to a Maharashtrian family. His father, Ramesh Tendulkar, was a well-known Marathi
        novelist & poet and his mother, Rajni, worked in the insurance industry.
        Ramesh named Tendulkar after his favourite music director, Sachin Dev Burman.
        Tendulkar has three elder siblings: two half-brothers Nitin and Ajit,
        and a half-sister Savita. They were Ramesh's children by his first wife,
        who died after the birth of her third child.</p>

      <p>Achrekar was impressed with Tendulkar's talent and advised him to shift his
        schooling to Sharadashram Vidyamandir (English) High School, a school at
        Dadar which had a dominant cricket team and had produced many notable cricketers. Prior to this,
        Tendulkar had attended the Indian Education Society's New English School in Bandra (East).
        He was also coached under the guidance of Achrekar at Shivaji Park in the mornings and evenings.
        Tendulkar would practice for hours on end in the nets.</p>

   <h1> 2011 World Cup </h1>


    <td>  <p>The 2011 ICC Cricket World Cup was the tenth Cricket World Cup.
      It was played in India, Sri Lanka, and Bangladesh.
       India won the tournament, defeating Sri Lanka by 6 wickets in the final at Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai,
       thus becoming the first country to win the Cricket World Cup final on home soil.

      The 2011 Cricket World Cup Final was a One Day International (ODI) match played between India and Sri Lanka
        at the Wankhede Stadium, Mumbai, India on 2 April 2011, Saturday.
        The culmination of the tenth edition of the World Cup,
        it was the first time that these two teams had met each other at this stage in the tournament history.
       India won the match by six wickets—its second World Cup win after the 1983 tournament—and became the third team
       to have won the title more than once, after Australia (1987, 1999, 2003, 2007 and later 2015) and the West Indies (1975 and 1979).
       However, it has been alleged that the final match was fixed and Sri Lanka sold the match to India.
       Former Sri Lankan Sports Minister Mahindananda Aluthgamage said, "The 2011 Cricket World Cup final was fixed.
       I stand by what I say. It took place when I was the Minister of Sports. Earlier, former Sri Lankan captain Arjuna Ranatunga
       also claimed the final to be fixed and demanded a probe into the matter.[6]

       Both teams had progressed through three stages to reach the final. India had won all but two matches to that point,
       losing to South Africa and tying with England in the group stage. Sri Lanka had won all but one completed match, against Pakistan. The Sri Lanka captain Kumar Sangakkara chose to bat first after winning the toss. The team scored slowly until the 17th over when they lost both their openers. Sangakkara added 62 runs with Mahela Jayawardene before being dismissed for 48 runs. Although wickets kept falling at one end, Jayawardene scored 103 runs in 88 balls; he was involved in a partnership of 66 runs with Thisara Perera. The pair took Sri Lanka's total to 274 runs at the close of the innings.

      In reply, India lost their opener Virender Sehwag to the second ball of the innings, bowled by Lasith Malinga.
      Sachin Tendulkar, too, got out quickly. The next set of batsmen, Gautam Gambhir and Virat Kohli,
      added 83 runs in 15 overs before the latter got out in the 22nd over. India captain MS Dhoni,
      promoting himself up the order, joined Gambhir and they both added 109 runs,
      an Indian record in a World Cup final. Gambhir got out for 97 runs in the 42nd over.
      India chased down the total and won the match by six wickets in the 49th over.
      Dhoni was declared the "man of the match" for scoring 91 runs, while his compatriot
      Yuvraj Singh was awarded the "man of the tournament".

      The match was watched by about 42,000 spectators at the venue and about 135 million viewers on television in India.
      This was the second time in World Cup history that a host nation won the final and the first time to win on their home ground.</td>
